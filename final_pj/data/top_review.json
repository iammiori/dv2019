    {"id": "healthy", "group" :2,"content":"- The menu spans healthy to indulgent, but I especially appreciate that the food they serve is tasty. The smoothies aren't chalky and the bowls aren't bland, and if you want real food they also have panini sandwiches too. Prices are reasonable for the portion and quality, and they do offer combo options and seasonal specials. Check their social media for discounts like their current weekday afternoon happy hour!<br><br>- Talk about making healthy food fun and tasty, this place does just that. It is an upscale casual, and is on the pricey side for casual, but you are paying for your health. The dishes are all sourced from local farmers and you can taste it. Even for someone that is not used to eating healthy, there are things on the menu for them.<br><br>- It was still tasty, but I misjudged the ratio of filling to lettuce leaf and had too much filling left. Not a bad problem because it was good all by itself, almost like a moo shu pork without the pork. Frankly all the dishes sound good here. Healthy too with a bit of an Asian accent on a lot of them like Teriyaki Quinoa and Spicy Panang Curry. The salads looked appetizing as they passed by, especially the $14 one that featured seasonal ingredients like asparagus and broccolini. The place was pretty packed for a weeknight with fit and aspiring-to-be-fit Phoenicians. No matter what end of the food pyramid I was eating, I just like what Dr. Weil has attempted to do here since the menu combines healthy and tasty in a refreshing way.<br>"},

    {"id": "professional", "group" :4, "content":"- A word about the service--it was as good as it gets.  The servers were attentive, professional, and friendly.   Dishes were promptly removed when a course was finished.  When my server came to check on me during the main course, he said he'd have another iced tea brought.  As he said that, we both saw one of the staff bringing me a fresh glass.  They didn't refill, they replaced with a full, new glass.  They were very impressive with their service.  <br><br>- We arrived a few minutes before our reservation time and were promptly seated and drink orders were taken as our group arrived in small groups a few minutes apart.The restaurant provided us with two assigned servers who were very proficient and other members of the staff joined in as needed to help serve the drinks and keep the bread and olive oil fully stocked on all the tables. The entire staff was very professional and outgoing and provide us with the best possible service the entire evening.<br><br>- Seeing a few new faces amongst the service staff, everyone professional yet fun as in the past, it was with a welcoming from Chef Smith that the meal got started and eschewing menus in favor of a carte blanche offering the first course of Summer Melons with French Ham and whipped Goat Cheese was a refreshing way to start the evening, the flavors of a Nicoise Salad next cleverly presented by way of acid-kissed Tuna beneath Olives and a Quail-Egg atop a piece of Toast.<br><br>- Evening started with a drink service in the bar area and the waitstaff were all attentive and professional.<br><br>"},
